# Predicting-Vinho-Verde-White-Wine-Quality-with-ML-regression-Models

## Brief Summary on the project:
Around 4898 data points related to white vinho verde wine samples from the north of Portugal were collected by vinho verde company.

The data set has 12 columns, as given below:

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity 
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide 
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates 
11. alcohol 
12. quality

## Objective: -
To predict the white wine quality given the measurements fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citric acid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulfur dioxide,total sulfer dioxide,density,pH,sulphates,alcohol,quality.
